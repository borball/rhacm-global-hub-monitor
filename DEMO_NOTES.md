# RHACM Global Hub Monitor - Demo Notes

**Building a Production Application with Cursor AI**

---

## 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

### Background

**The Problem:**
- Managing multiple RHACM hub clusters across different environments
- Each hub manages hundreds of spoke clusters (Single Node OpenShift)
- No single pane of glass to monitor all hubs
- Need to SSH into each hub cluster individually
- Tedious to check status, policies, operators across infrastructure

**The Vision:**
- Build a web application to monitor all RHACM hubs from one place
- Show cluster status, policies, operators
- Visual dashboard for quick infrastructure overview
- Modern, user-friendly interface

**Why Cursor AI:**
- Rapid development with AI assistance
- Iterative improvement based on feedback
- Complex multi-cluster integration
- Full-stack development (Go backend + JavaScript frontend)

---

## 2. The Journey: 4 Development Sprints (10 minutes)

### Sprint 0 (v0): Foundation - "Get Something Working"

**Initial Request:**
> "I want to monitor my RHACM hub clusters and their spoke clusters"

**What We Built:**
- Basic Go backend with Gin framework
- Simple vanilla JavaScript frontend
- Kubernetes API integration
- Card-based UI showing hubs and spokes

**Key Challenge:** 
Multi-cluster access - how to connect to different hub clusters?

**Solution:** 
Kubeconfig secrets pattern: `{hub-name}-admin-kubeconfig`

**Demo Point:** 
*"In 1 day, we went from idea to working prototype. Cursor helped scaffold the entire application structure."*

---

### Sprint 1 (v1): Hub Management - "Make It Useful"

**New Requirements:**
- Add/remove hub clusters dynamically
- Enforce non-compliant policies
- Don't require restart when adding hubs

**What We Added:**
- POST /api/hubs/add - Dynamic hub addition
- Policy enforcement via ClusterGroupUpgrade (CGU)
- Hub categorization (managed vs unmanaged)
- Add Hub form in UI

**Key Challenge:**
How to add hubs without redeployment?

**Solution:**
Create kubeconfig secrets via API, backend discovers them automatically

**Demo Point:**
*"Cursor understood RHACM concepts like CGU and helped implement complex policy enforcement logic."*

---

### Sprint 2 (v2): Performance - "Make It Fast"

**The Problem:**
Page taking 45+ seconds to load - completely unusable!

**Investigation:**
Every page load fetched all data from scratch across multiple clusters

**What We Built:**
- In-memory caching with 90-second TTL
- Code refactoring (eliminated ~200 duplicate lines)
- Console and GitOps URL integration

**Results:**
- First load: ~10 seconds (acceptable)
- Cached load: ~25ms
- **350x performance improvement!**

**Demo Point:**
*"Cursor helped identify performance bottlenecks and implement caching patterns. A simple cache transformed the user experience."*

---

### Sprint 3 (v3): Modern UX - "Make It Beautiful"

**New Requirements:**
- Professional dark/light mode
- Operators monitoring (scales to 1000+ spokes)
- Better caching (30 minutes)
- Per-hub refresh capability

**Major Features:**

**1. Dark/Light Mode (6+ iterations!)**
- CSS variables for theming
- Toggle button
- Every component themed
- **Challenge:** Finding all hardcoded white backgrounds
- *Cursor helped iterate through 100+ UI components*

**2. Operators Tab**
- List all installed operators
- **Challenge:** Performance with 1000+ spoke clusters
- **Solution:** Lazy loading (fetch on-demand)
- Smart grouping (304 installations → 45 unique operators)

**3. Simplified Deployment**
- One command: `./deploy.sh`
- All Kubernetes resources in single file
- Portable across clusters

**Key Issues Solved (16 total!):**
1. White backgrounds in dark mode (6 iterations)
2. Operators lazy loading for scale
3. Template literal syntax errors
4. Multi-pod cache consistency (session affinity)
5. And many more...

**Demo Point:**
*"Cursor was like pair programming with an expert. Each issue we found, it helped solve iteratively. The dark mode took 6 rounds, but Cursor never complained!"*

## 4. Cursor AI Collaboration (7 minutes)

### How Cursor Helped

**1. Rapid Scaffolding**
- "Create a Go backend with Gin that lists Kubernetes resources"
- Full API structure in minutes
- Proper error handling included

**2. Complex Logic**
```
Me: "Fetch operators but only when spoke is expanded"
Cursor: Implemented lazy loading with proper state management
```

**3. Iterative Refinement**
```
Me: "Still seeing white backgrounds in dark mode"
Cursor: Found 6 more locations, provided fixes
(This happened 6 times - Cursor was patient!)
```

**4. Performance Optimization**
```
Me: "Page is too slow"
Cursor: Analyzed, suggested caching, implemented solution
Result: 350x improvement
```

**5. Multi-Cluster Complexity**
- Understanding RHACM concepts
- Kubeconfig parsing
- Authentication methods
- Session affinity for caching

### Development Workflow with Cursor

**Typical Interaction:**
1. **Describe problem:** "Users can't see newly added hub without refresh"
2. **Cursor analyzes:** Reviews code, identifies client-side cache issue
3. **Cursor proposes:** `delete window.cachedHubsData; fetchHubs()`
4. **I test:** Add hub, verify page refreshes
5. **Cursor commits:** Only after I confirm it works

**Test-Before-Commit Principle:**
- Build → Deploy → Test → Verify → Commit
- Cursor learned to wait for my verification
- No untested code in production

---

## 5. Key Challenges & Solutions (5 minutes)

### Challenge 1: Cache Not Working (Multi-Pod)

**Problem:**
- 2 backend pods, each with own cache
- Sometimes fast (50ms), sometimes slow (10s)
- Random based on which pod serves request

**How Cursor Helped:**
```
Me: "Cache is inconsistent"
Cursor: "You have multiple pods. Add session affinity."
Solution: sessionAffinity: ClientIP in service
```

**Result:** Consistent performance per client

### Challenge 2: Operators for 1000+ Spokes

**Problem:**
```
Me: "Need to show operators for all spokes"
Cursor: "That will be too slow with 1000+ spokes"
```

**Solution Cursor Proposed:**
- Don't fetch on initial load
- Lazy load when spoke is expanded
- Show "..." in table, fetch on-demand

**Result:** Fast page load, scalable to thousands

### Challenge 3: Dark Mode - 6 Iterations

**Conversation Flow:**
```
Iteration 1:
Me: "Add dark mode"
Cursor: *Implements CSS variables, toggle button*

Iteration 2:
Me: "Policy details have white backgrounds"
Cursor: *Adds .policy-detail-row class*

Iteration 3:
Me: "Summary cards still white"
Cursor: *Adds .policy-summary-card class*

... (4 more iterations)

Iteration 6:
Me: "Finally perfect!"
```

**Demo Point:**
*"Cursor never got frustrated with iterations. Each round, it found more white backgrounds and fixed them."*

---

## 6. Deployment Evolution (3 minutes)

### Initial Deployment (v0-v1)
- 11 manual kubectl commands
- Error-prone
- 30+ minutes

### v3 Simplified Deployment
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
- One command
- Automated
- 5 minutes
- All resources created

**How We Got There:**
```
Me: "Too many manual steps"
Cursor: *Created all-in-one.yaml with all resources*
Cursor: *Wrote deploy.sh script with progress indicators*
```

**Deployment Lessons Learned:**
- Image pull policy matters (`Always` vs `IfNotPresent`)
- Session affinity critical for caching
- ConfigMaps for frontend files
- Portable configuration (no hardcoded domains)

**5. Test-Before-Commit Discipline**
```
Initial approach: Code → Commit → Oops
Learned approach: Code → Deploy → Test → Verify → Commit

Cursor adapted to this workflow and enforced it.
```

### Challenges Overcome Together

**1. Deployment Issues**
- Spent hours trying to deploy new code
- Old images kept running
- **Learning:** Image tagging and Kubernetes caching is complex
- **Cursor helped:** Multiple deployment strategies until one worked

**2. Authentication Complexity**
- Unmanaged hubs authenticating as anonymous
- Tried 5+ different approaches
- **Learning:** Basic auth deprecated in Kubernetes
- **Cursor helped:** Debug logging to identify root cause

**3. JavaScript Template Literals**
- Nested template literals caused syntax errors
- **Learning:** Don't nest more than 2 levels
- **Cursor helped:** Refactored to string concatenation

### Best Practices Developed

**1. Always Test Before Commit**
- Build → Deploy → Test → Verify → Commit
- Never commit untested code
- Cursor learned to wait for my verification

**2. Use Specific, Testable Metrics**
- "Make it faster" → "Reduce load time from 45s to <1s"
- "Add dark mode" → "Zero white backgrounds in dark mode"
- Measurable goals = better results

**3. Start Simple, Add Complexity**
- v0: Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Could have added React, Vue, etc.
- **Kept it simple:** Easier to understand, modify, deploy
- **Cursor excels** at vanilla code

**4. Document As You Go**
- Each sprint got documentation
- Cursor helped write clear, useful docs
- By v3, had comprehensive documentation set

---

## 10. Technical Deep Dives (Optional - 5 minutes)

### Code Example 1: Lazy Loading Pattern

**The Problem:**
```
1000 spoke clusters × operator fetch = page never loads
```

**The Solution:**
```javascript
// Don't fetch upfront
spokeRow.innerHTML = `<td>...</td>`;

// Fetch on expansion
async function expandSpoke(spokeName) {
    const operators = await fetch(`/api/hubs/${hub}/spokes/${spoke}/operators`);
    updateRow(operators);
}
```

**Cursor's Contribution:**
- Suggested lazy loading pattern
- Implemented loading states
- Added error handling
- Cached results in browser

### Code Example 2: Dark Mode with CSS Variables

**Before (Hardcoded):**
```css
.card {
    background: #ffffff;  /* Hardcoded white! */
}
```

**After (Themed):**
```css
:root {
    --bg-secondary: #ffffff;  /* Light mode */
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
    --bg-secondary: #1c2128;  /* Dark mode */
}

.card {
    background: var(--bg-secondary);  /* Themeable! */
}
```

**Finding All White Backgrounds:**
```
Me: "Still have white backgrounds"
Cursor: *Searches codebase*
Cursor: "Found 6 more locations: policy-summary, hardware-grid, code-blocks..."
Me: "Fixed them"
(Repeat 6 times)
```

### Code Example 3: Session Affinity for Caching

**The Bug:**
```yaml
# 2 backend pods, separate caches
# Request 1 → Pod A → Slow (10s)
# Request 2 → Pod B → Slow (10s)  # Different pod!
```

**The Fix:**
```yaml
spec:
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP
  sessionAffinityConfig:
    clientIP:
      timeoutSeconds: 10800  # 3 hours
```

**Result:**
```yaml
# Same client → Same pod → Fast (25ms)
```

**Cursor's Role:**
- Identified distributed caching issue
- Suggested session affinity
- Provided YAML configuration
- Explained trade-offs

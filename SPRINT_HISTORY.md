3. Improve policy management capabilities

**Requirements:**
- Add hub clusters without redeployment
- Store unmanaged hub configurations
- Enforce non-compliant policies via CGU
- YAML download for policies
- Better hub categorization (managed vs unmanaged)

### Implementation

**Hub Management:**
- POST /api/hubs/add - Add unmanaged hubs
- DELETE /api/hubs/:name/remove - Remove hubs
- Kubeconfig storage in secrets

- **Implementation:** Store kubeconfig as K8s secret, monitor discovers it
- **Result:** Zero-downtime hub addition

**Issue 2: Policy Enforcement**
- **Problem:** How to trigger policy remediation for non-compliant clusters
- **Solution:** Integrate with ClusterGroupUpgrade (CGU) resource
- **Technical:** Create CGU with policy references, ZTP wave configuration
- **Result:** One-click policy enforcement

**Issue 3: Unmanaged vs Managed Hubs**
- **Problem:** Confusion between hub types
- **Solution:** Label-based categorization with `source: manual` annotation
- **Pattern:** 
  - Managed: Auto-discovered from ManagedCluster resources
  - Unmanaged: Manually added via UI
- **Result:** Clear separation and different handling

**Issue 4: Policy YAML Access**
- **Problem:** Users needed policy definitions for troubleshooting
- **Solution:** Created policy YAML download endpoint

- Direct links to OpenShift Console
- Direct links to GitOps (Argo CD)
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Aligned UI layout

### Implementation

**Performance Caching:**
- In-memory cache with 90-second TTL
- Cache keys: "hubs:list" and "hub:{name}"
- Thread-safe implementation
- Automatic expiration

**Console/GitOps Integration:**
- Fetch Route resources from hubs
- Extract console-openshift-console route
- Extract openshift-gitops-server route
- Display as clickable links on hub cards

**Code Refactoring:**

- Consistent info-row styling
- Better badge positioning
- Context-aware display

### Major Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Terrible Performance (45+ seconds)**
- **Problem:** Each page load took 45+ seconds
- **Root Cause:** Fetching all data from scratch every time
- **Solution:** Implemented 90-second TTL cache
- **Results:** 
  - First load: ~10s (acceptable)
  - Cached load: ~25ms
  - **350x performance improvement!**

**Issue 2: Route Discovery for Console/GitOps**
- **Problem:** Need to find console and GitOps URLs dynamically
- **Challenge:** Routes have standard names but need discovery
- **Solution:** 
  ```go
  // Search for console route
  routes, err := GetRoutes(ctx, "openshift-console")
  // Find route with "console" prefix
  // Extract host and build https:// URL
  ```
- **Result:** Automatic URL discovery, clickable links

**Issue 3: Code Duplication**
- **Problem:** Managed and unmanaged hubs had separate, duplicate code paths
- **Impact:** Hard to maintain, bug-prone
- **Solution:** Created enrichHubWithRemoteData() function
- **Pattern:**
  ```go
  func enrichHubWithRemoteData(hub, hubClient) {
      // Fetch ClusterVersion
      // Get Console/GitOps routes  
      // Fetch nodes
      // Get policies
      // Get spokes
  }
  ```
- **Result:** ~200 lines eliminated, single code path

**Issue 4: Cache Invalidation**
- **Problem:** How to get fresh data when needed
- **Challenge:** 90-second cache good for performance, but how to refresh?
- **Initial Solution:** Wait for expiry
- **Note:** Manual refresh deferred to v3

**Issue 5: Missing Context**
- **Problem:** Console/GitOps links available but not visible
- **Solution:** Added prominent display on hub cards
- **Pattern:** Two-button layout at bottom of each card
- **Result:** Quick access to external tools

### Key Learnings

- Caching provides massive performance gains (350x!)
- 90-second TTL balances freshness and performance
- Route discovery through K8s API works reliably
- Code consolidation prevents bugs
- External tool integration (Console/GitOps) highly valuable

### Feature Requests

**Primary Goals:**
1. Implement dark/light mode theming
2. Add operators monitoring
3. Improve caching strategy
4. Add manual refresh capability
5. Better status handling

**Detailed Requirements:**

**Dark Mode:**
- Professional dark theme (GitHub-inspired)
- Modern light theme
- Theme persistence
- All components must support both themes
- Smooth transitions

**Operators:**
- Show installed operators on hubs
- Show operators on spoke clusters
- Display operator versions
- Performance must scale to 1000+ spokes

**Caching:**
- Extend cache TTL to 30 minutes
- Add manual refresh buttons
- Per-hub refresh (not whole page)
- Maintain performance

### Implementation

**1. Dark/Light Mode (Major Feature)**

**Implementation:**
- CSS custom properties (variables) for all colors
- Two complete color schemes
- localStorage for persistence
- Toggle button in header

**Color Schemes:**
```css
Light Mode:
  --bg-primary: #f5f7fa
  --bg-secondary: #ffffff
  --text-primary: #1f2937

Dark Mode:
  --bg-primary: #0f1419
  --bg-secondary: #1c2128
  --text-primary: #e6edf3
```

**Coverage:**
- 100+ UI components themed
- All pages, cards, tables
- Forms, inputs, buttons
- Status badges, code blocks
- Policy details, spoke expansions

**2. Operators Tab (Major Feature)**

**Backend:**
- Created OperatorInfo model
- GetOperators() fetches ClusterServiceVersion resources
- Lazy loading endpoint for spoke operators
- NewSpokeClientFromKubeconfig() for spoke connections

**Frontend:**
- Full operators tab for hubs
- Lazy loading for spoke operators
- Smart grouping by operator name
- Search/filter functionality

**Performance Strategy:**
- Hub operators: Included in hub load (acceptable delay)
- Spoke operators: Lazy loaded on expansion (scalable)
- Result: Scales to 1000+ spokes without performance impact

**3. Caching Enhancements**

**Backend:**
- Extended TTL: 90 seconds → 30 minutes
- Shared cache instance across handlers
- Per-hub cache invalidation
- Endpoint: POST /api/hubs/:name/refresh

**Frontend:**
- Client-side navigation cache (window.cachedHubsData)
- Instant "Back to Hubs" navigation
- 🔄 Refresh button on each hub card
- Partial page refresh (only update specific card)

**4. Status & UX Improvements**

- Three-state status: Ready/NotReady/Unknown
- Conditional policy colors (green only if 100% compliant)
- Compact layouts (policy details ~50% smaller)
- Policies tab hidden for unmanaged hubs with 0 policies

### Major Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: White Backgrounds in Dark Mode**
- **Problem:** Many components had hardcoded white (#ffffff) backgrounds
- **Scope:** Policy details, stat cards, code blocks, hardware cards
- **Investigation:** Found ~20 locations with hardcoded colors
- **Solution:** 
  - Created themed CSS classes
  - Replaced inline `background: white` with `var(--bg-secondary)`
  - Created .policy-summary-card, .code-block, .hardware-grid-item
- **Iterations:** 5+ rounds of fixes as more white backgrounds discovered
- **Result:** Perfect dark mode with no white backgrounds

**Issue 2: Operators Performance at Scale**
- **Problem:** Fetching operators for 1000+ spokes would take too long
- **Initial Approach:** Fetch all operators upfront
- **User Feedback:** "Page won't load well with 1000+ clusters"
- **Solution:** Implemented lazy loading
  - Don't fetch spoke operators on initial load
  - Create endpoint: GET /api/hubs/:name/spokes/:spoke/operators
  - Fetch only when spoke details expanded
  - Show "..." in table, "Loading..." on expansion
- **Result:** Fast initial load, on-demand operator fetching

**Issue 3: Operator Duplication**
- **Problem:** Same operator in 10 namespaces = 10 table rows
- **Example:** 304 operator installations cluttering display
- **Solution:** Smart grouping by displayName
  - Group operators with same name
  - Show namespace count: "5 ns"
  - List first 3 namespaces with "+X more"
- **Result:** 304 installations → 45 unique operators (clean display)

**Issue 4: Spoke Operators Not Showing**
- **Problem:** sno146 has 7 operators but showing 0
- **Root Cause:** Operators installed ON spoke cluster, not on hub
- **Investigation:** Tried fetching from spoke namespace on hub (failed)
- **Solution:** Connect directly to spoke via kubeconfig
  - Kubeconfig stored in spoke's namespace on hub
  - Secret: `{spoke}-admin-kubeconfig`
  - Create spoke client, fetch operators directly
- **Result:** 7 operators successfully fetched for sno146

**Issue 5: JavaScript Syntax Error in Template Literals**
- **Problem:** "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token at line 1855"
- **Root Cause:** Nested template literals with escaped backticks
  ```javascript
  ${hub.url ? \`<a href="${hub.url}"...\` : ''}
  ```
- **Solution:** Replace with string concatenation
  ```javascript
  (hub.url ? '<a href="' + hub.url + '"...' : '')
  ```
- **Result:** Clean, parseable JavaScript

**Issue 6: Cache Not Working Across Requests**
- **Problem:** Each request took 10+ seconds despite caching code
- **Root Cause:** Each handler creating its own cache instance
  ```go
  func NewHubHandler(client) {
      cache: cache.NewCache(30*time.Minute) // NEW instance each time!
  }
  ```
- **Solution:** Create shared cache in main.go
  ```go
  sharedCache := cache.NewCache(30*time.Minute)
  hubHandler := NewHubHandler(client, sharedCache)
  ```
- **Result:** 10s → 50ms (200x improvement)

**Issue 7: Inconsistent Cache Performance (Multi-Pod)**
- **Problem:** Sometimes fast (50ms), sometimes slow (10s)
- **Investigation:** 2 backend pods, each with separate cache
- **Root Cause:** Load balancer randomly distributing requests
  - Request hits Pod A → fast (cached in Pod A)
  - Request hits Pod B → slow (not cached in Pod B)
- **Solution:** Enable session affinity
  ```yaml
  sessionAffinity: ClientIP
  sessionAffinityConfig:
    clientIP:
      timeoutSeconds: 10800  # 3 hours
  ```
- **Result:** Consistent performance per client

**Issue 8: Cache Expiring Every 2 Minutes**
- **Problem:** Cache configured for 30 minutes but expiring every ~2 minutes
- **Evidence:** Logs showing 10s requests 2 minutes apart
- **Timeline:**
  ```
  18:00:04 - 10.665s (cache miss)
  18:02:22 - 10.535s (cache miss) ← Only 2min 18sec!
  ```
- **Investigation:** Added cache HIT/MISS logging
- **Status:** Under investigation at project completion
- **Workaround:** 2-minute cache still provides performance benefit

**Issue 9: Refresh Button Showing Entire Page Reload**
- **Problem:** Clicking refresh reloaded whole page
- **Impact:** Statistics cards disappeared, scroll position lost
- **User Feedback:** "Should only reload certain area"
- **Solution:** Implemented partial page refresh
  - Created .managed-hubs-section and .unmanaged-hubs-section
  - New function: renderHubSections() 
  - Only updates hub cards, not statistics
- **Further Refinement:** Moved to per-hub refresh buttons
  - Individual 🔄 button on each card
  - Granular control
  - Endpoint: POST /api/hubs/:name/refresh

**Issue 10: Loading Spinner on Homepage Return**
- **Problem:** Navigating back to homepage showed loading spinner
- **Impact:** Poor perceived performance
- **Solution:** Client-side caching
  ```javascript
  window.cachedHubsData = data.data;
  
  function returnToHomepage() {
      if (window.cachedHubsData) {
          renderHubsList(window.cachedHubsData); // Instant!
      }
  }
  ```
- **Result:** Instant homepage display on back navigation

**Issue 11: Status Color Consistency**
- **Problem:** acm1/acm2 showed "Connected" in orange, production-hub in green
- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent status checking
  ```go
  // Managed hubs:
  statusClass = status.includes('ready') ? 'ready' : 'notready'
  
  // Unmanaged hubs:  
  statusClass = status.includes('ready') || status.includes('connected') ? ...
  ```
- **Solution:** Unified status checking for both hub types
- **Result:** All "Connected" statuses show green consistently

**Issue 12: Unknown Status Handling**
- **Problem:** Clusters with Unknown status showed as "NotReady"
- **User Input:** "oc get mcl shows AVAILABLE: Unknown but UI shows NotReady"
- **Solution:** Three-state status system
  ```go
  switch condition.Status {
  case ConditionTrue: return "Ready"
  case ConditionFalse: return "NotReady"
  case ConditionUnknown: return "Unknown"
  }
  ```
- **UI:** Gray badge for Unknown status
- **Result:** Accurate status representation

**Issue 13: Policy Colors Always Green**
- **Problem:** Policies stat card always green, even for 18/19 compliant
- **User Feedback:** "Color should not be green in this case"
- **Solution:** Conditional coloring
  ```javascript
  compliantPolicies === policyCount ? 'green' : 'orange'
  ```
- **Result:** Green only for 100% compliance

**Issue 14: Operators Section Spacing**
- **Problem:** Extra whitespace before labels/annotations
- **User Feedback:** "Still have spaces before the first label"
- **Root Cause:** Template string indentation creating whitespace
  ```javascript
  <div class="code-block">
      ${content}  // ← Newline creates space
  </div>
  ```
- **Solution:** Put content on same line
  ```javascript
  <div class="code-block">${content}</div>
  ```
- **Result:** Compact, clean display

**Issue 15: Operators Not Loading (Stuck on "Loading...")**
- **Problem:** Operators section showed "Loading..." indefinitely
- **Root Cause:** Text comparison was too strict
  ```javascript
  if (operatorsCell.textContent === 'Loading...') // Failed due to whitespace
  ```
- **Solution:** More flexible matching
  ```javascript
  if (operatorsCell.textContent.trim().includes('Loading'))
  ```
- **Added:** Console logging for debugging
- **Result:** Operators load properly on expansion

**Issue 16: Image Pull Policy**
- **Problem:** Pods not pulling latest images from Quay.io
- **Root Cause:** imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent (default)
- **Impact:** Latest code not deployed despite pushing to Quay
- **User Request:** "Quay.io is back, change to Always"
- **Solution:** 
  ```bash
  oc patch deployment rhacm-monitor-backend \
    -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"...","imagePullPolicy":"Always"}]}}}}'
  ```
- **Result:** Always pulls latest image, easier deployment

### Progressive Enhancement Pattern

**Iteration 1:** Basic dark mode
**Issue:** Policy details had white backgrounds
**Fix:** Add .policy-detail-row class

**Iteration 2:** More dark mode fixes
**Issue:** Summary cards still white
**Fix:** Add .policy-summary-card class

**Iteration 3:** Even more fixes
**Issue:** Hardware cards white
**Fix:** Add .hardware-grid-item class

**Iteration 4-6:** Continued refinement
- Spoke detail rows
- Input fields
- Code blocks
- Labels/annotations
- Every white background eliminated

**Pattern:** Iterative discovery and fix, ~6 rounds total

### Architecture Decisions

**Lazy Loading Strategy:**
- **Decision:** Don't fetch spoke operators on initial load
- **Rationale:** Performance at scale (1000+ spokes)
- **Trade-off:** Extra API call on expansion vs slow initial load
- **Outcome:** Right choice - fast initial load, acceptable expansion delay

**Cache Strategy:**
- **Decision:** In-memory cache per pod with session affinity
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Redis (shared cache) - Too complex for v3
  - Single pod - Less HA
  - No cache - Too slow
- **Chosen:** In-memory + sticky sessions
- **Trade-off:** Not shared across pods but simple and effective

**Client-Side Cache:**
- **Decision:** Add window.cachedHubsData for instant navigation
- **Rationale:** User perception of performance
- **Implementation:** Simple, no dependencies
- **Result:** Instant back navigation, better UX

### Technical Debt & Future Items

**Cache TTL Investigation:**
- Configured: 30 minutes
- Actual: ~2 minutes  
- Status: Needs investigation
- Impact: Minor (still provides benefit)

**Spoke Operator Kubeconfig:**
- Requires setup (kubeconfig secrets)
- Not automatic
- Documented in OPERATORS_SETUP.md
- Future: Could automate

**Refresh Endpoint Deployment:**
- Code ready
- Endpoint registered
- Needs image pull to activate
- Working after imagePullPolicy: Always

### Key Learnings

- Iterative fixing works for comprehensive changes (dark mode)
- Lazy loading essential for scale
- Client-side caching complements backend caching
- Session affinity solves multi-pod cache consistency
- Template literal nesting gets complex (use concatenation)
- User feedback drives important refinements
